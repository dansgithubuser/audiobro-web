<h2>Intro</h2>
Audiobro is an amateur album made with <a href="https://github.com/dansgithubuser/dlal">Dan's Live Audio Lab</a> (dlal).
Started in September 2017 and released in August 2024, it served as a "focus" to the ever-expansive exploration in dlal.
The album was created with the help of my audio bro.
We had an established pattern of hanging out and jamming something up.
I suggested to start recording our jam sessions so I could take each recording back and turn it into a track.
Originally the goal was 3 jam sessions and 3 tracks, but the 4th track struck me and stuck with me, and the 5th is based off a performance we did in 2009.

<h2>Release Goals</h2>
I'm not going to bother putting together a license. I have no idea what that means and I'm not (presently) interested to find out. Instead I'd like to describe what I want to get out of <i>releasing</i> this album. Let's do a list:

<ul>
  <li>If you're a coder and audio enthusiast, and you're interested in what you heard, consider taking a look at <a href="https://github.com/dansgithubuser/dlal">dlal</a>.</li>
  <li>If you know me personally, I'd like you to enjoy these tracks and if you feel like it, talk to me about them.</li>
  <li>If you're a creator, feel free to use the tracks, but please don't do silly thinks like claim them as your own, and try to find a place to link this page. <a href="mailto:dansonlinepresence@gmail.com">Email</a> me if you want some modified version of a track.</li>
  <li>I don't want money, because it introduces more logistics around not-creating than I'm willing to accept. If something viral happens, I reserve the right to revise this.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Details by Track (spoilers?)</h2>
<h3>Track 1</h3>
<p>
After explaining my idea and having the first jam session (at his place and on his setup), I sent an email with the subject "yo send the audio bro". This is the only thing that ever popped out to me as an appropriate album title.
</p>

<p>
Once the minor loop was established, my audio bro tried to fit a major line in (the bells in the final track). This is the kind of thing we'd try to do: make a pattern, then carefully throw a wrench in it.
</p>

<h3>Burgers</h3>
<p>
The second jam session happened at my place, and we had some burgers on a cheap charcoal barbecue beforehand. Afterward we repeated and recorded some of our conversation. While barbecuing, I came up with the following burger recipe:
<ul>
  <li>Take the stem off a portabello mushroom, and cook it.</li>
  <li>Turn the mushroom upside down and put brie cheese in. This allows the brie to melt without escaping the mushroom.</li>
  <li>Take a plain burger (bun, patty), add the mushroom and brie, and add pickles (do I want a pickle on my burger?).</li>
</ul>
I was so pleased with the result, I said to my bro, "People, they think they know burgers, but they haven't been here."
</p>

<p>
I think it had been a while since I used the barbecue and so I forgot it had legs. Next time we'll find its legs.
</p>

<h3>The Legend of Bass Man</h3>
<p>
The jam session behind this track really demonstrates the nature of audio bros and careful wrench-throwing. Halfway into a tour of the instruments at my place, my audio bro starts reciting (improvising) The Legend of Bass Man. When tracking, I felt the only true artistic implementation was to make a robotic singing voice to recite The Legend. It's also a topic I was previously interested in. By robotic I mean the artist should be able to write down notes and (phonetic) lyrics and get a singing voice out of it, with complete control. It would also be great to figure out how to do it live so it could be performed with. I knew this would be hard, but it was harder (and therefore also took longer) than I thought it would. Nonetheless, the learnings (remember, the whole point of the album is to focus audio explorations in dlal) kept paying off.
</p>

<p>
I avoided deep learning speech synthesis for a while, because I knew with deep speech, I couldn't have control over pitch and timing to make it sing. Eventually though, two things happened. First, I became somewhat confident the only barrier between me and intelligible speech was details in how phonetics work. For example, the aspiration (h sound) that follows the p in "pick". My goal was never to deal with how phonetics work in any particular language, only to synthesize a good phonetic description into a singing robot. Second, I learned enough to take an intelligible utterance, take phonetic information out of it, and arbitrarily pick how that phonetic information is timed and pitched. In the end, this is what I went with to get the track done. This method will not work in a live setting, because the deep speech generation is slow, and the timing is manual. Some day I'd like to figure out how to get a robot voice working in a live setting.
</p>

<p>
Bass Man will return...?
</p>

<h3>Track 4</h3>
The concept for this track that struck me and stuck with me is this: take the bass riff from track 1 and turn it into an orchestral tragedy. Then, take the riff out. At the end, put it back in as a punchline. I'm a big fan of cerebral musical jokes like this, and I think they're present in the whole album. Another way I think of it: any short segment of the album should sound like it is taking itself seriously, but beyond that there should be an eclectic wackiness.

<h3>Bassindaface / Funky Funky Bass</h3>
<p>
In 2009 my audio bro and I decided to do a performance at something like a talent show. I had a bassoon and he had a bass guitar. We created the concept "Bassindaface" where we'd be trying to out-bass each other. The lowest note on a bassoon is a Bb1 (~58 Hz); the lowest note on a bass guitar is E1 (~41 Hz) and they follow from the question, "What's the lowest note you can play?". The diminished riff follows from those two notes.
</p>

<p>
Funky Funky Bass is the onomatopoeia of a different bassline I had invented previously that I offered to Bassindaface.
</p>

<p>
The performance featured the basslines in an ABA format, and us telling a bunch of bad bass puns. At the end, audio bro detuned the lowest string so the note was lower. I reinterpreted this into the 5th track in a way I suspect most people won't notice. If you have perfect pitch, I'm curious if anything seems funny.
</p>

<h2>Specific Influences</h2>
There's some specific pieces of music that I love that I used as inspiration for some passages, that I'd like to mention as a celebration of them. I hope I've done a good job reinterpreting the musical ideas so as not to be derivative.

<ul>
  <li>Power Flower 1 from Sub-Terrania, opening chords into the track 1 midsection chords.</li>
  <li>Holst's Neptune for polyrhythm arpeggios, tracks 2 and 4.</li>
  <li>D/Generation intro song, which I confused with the Sim City 2000 Budget Screen. In track 2 midsection.</li>
  <li>Ecco the Dolphin: The Tides of Time, Title Theme in a few places, but especially the 4th track.</li>
  <li>A specific build-up from Beast Wars that I have no idea how to track down, but I (think I) remember it went up in minor 3rds. Minor 3rd chord changes are a tiny and therefore common idea, but I tried to recreate the feeling that stuck with me in the track 5 opening.</li>
  <li>Moonlight Sonata, 3rd Movement, those diminished chords toward the end. In the 5th track when we get back to the Bassindaface riff.</li>
  <li>Descent, Level 22, mid-section bassline fit perfectly with Bassindaface.</li>
  <li>Dancing Mad from Final Fantasy 6, and In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida for the structure of the 5th track. The eclecticness of styles in these tracks really match the vibe I want.</li>
  <li>Descent, Level 8. This is more of an honorable/loving mention because I can't find a place in the album to point. But the initial chord change is always kicking around in my head.</li>
</ul>
